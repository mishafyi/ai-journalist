/**
 * ai-journalist — the PUBLIC entry: `runPipeline(input: RunInput) → GeneratedPost`.
 *
 * This is the engine's whole usable surface for an adopter. Given the four ports
 * (Source / Sink / Linker / EngineConfig — see ./ports), it runs BOTH phases
 * end-to-end:
 *
 *   1. DISCOVER — pull the Source's signal and pick + plan the story. A fixed
 *      `input.topic` plans THAT story (operator path, no anti-repetition); an
 *      omitted topic discovers a fresh, uncovered one from the signal.
 *   2. GENERATE — run the section-research → gate-chain orchestration
 *      (`runGeneration`) to a publish-ready article.
 *   3. PUBLISH — hand the finished post to the Sink (unless `dryRun`), then
 *      return the `GeneratedPost` either way (so a dry run yields it for review).
 *
 * "Plug any data in", made usable: an adopter brings the four ports, calls this,
 * and gets a finished post — no engine code.
 *
 * Engine-pure: imports ONLY sibling engine modules — NOTHING from a host app,
 * ORM, or framework. The couplings a full host's `runGeneration` needs but the
 * four ports can't express (the DATA gathers, the content-rewriting link
 * functions, the named knobs, the per-run telemetry) ride in through
 * `input.internals` (an OPTIONAL, engine-pure carrier the adapter populates —
 * see `EngineInternals` in ./ports). The entry maps the public ports it CAN onto
 * the engine deps (`config.llm` → the discovery `llm`, `source.gatherSignal` /
 * `coveredTopics`, `sink.publish`) and reads the rest from the carrier — that
 * port→deps wiring IS the adapter↔engine boundary made explicit.
 *
 * Behavior-preserving: the discovery → generation → publish CALL ORDER and the
 * inputs to each are byte-for-byte what the old `main()` ran inline; only the
 * couplings became injected. The golden guard replays the whole thing through
 * `runBlogAuto` → `main` → here.
